# GetLinked Tech Hackathon 2023

Welcome to my submission for the GetLinked Tech Hackathon 2023! In this project, I've implemented a beautiful UI design into code on the frontend, following the guidelines provided in the Figma design file. My work includes creating a dynamic landing page with multiple engaging sections, a user-friendly contact page, and a seamless registration process.
